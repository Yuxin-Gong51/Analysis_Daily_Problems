# Analysis Daily problems

This problems set is created and typed in $`\LaTeX`$ when I was a first year student at Imperial College London studying Mathematics. It contains many common questions in Analysis 
that can be seen at first year. Including the series, sequence, limits of functions, continuity of functions. Many questions are famous and some solutions are implemented 
for them. Most of them are collected from elementary books in analysis. I will reference them in the `README.md` file.

## How to use my problem set
There are both `.tex` file and `.pdf` file in the first folder. Just click it, then you will be able to see the files inside it. The problems are separated day by day. Each day will contain $`5`$ 
problems. After you learn all the knowledge for the first year analysis, you will be able to complete all of them. If there are any typos or questions in them, please [email me](yg2523@ic.ac.uk).
